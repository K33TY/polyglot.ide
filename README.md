Supporting the adoption of new languages is hard because
developers expect to have IDE support. The Polyglot IDE addresses
this issue by providing an extensible IDE integrated with the
[Polyglot compiler framework](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/polyglot/).
With the Polyglot IDE, you can extend Java with new language
features, such as domain-specific extensions, and obtain an IDE
for your new language.

The Polyglot IDE is an Eclipse plug-in that behaves similar to
the Java IDE implemented by Eclipse's JDT. It can be [installed
easily through Eclipse](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/polyglot/ide/).
Polyglot extension developers can readily extend the Polyglot IDE to
support their own language.

Implemented features include code editing and highlighting,
compilation, and integrated error reporting. There is some
code-navigation support, and an extensible project-creation
wizard.

Some features remain unimplemented, but desirable, such as
debugging support, full navigation, and refactoring support. We
hope to generate interest in the user community for adding these
features.
