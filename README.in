The code for Polyglot IDE is freely available on GitHub. To obtain
a copy, clone the following URL:

  https://github.com/polyglot-compiler/polyglot.ide.git

The source repository contains the following sub-directories:

  - base/src: the source code for the Polyglot IDE sub-project,
              which supports the Polyglot base compiler

  - jl5/src: the source code for the JL5 IDE sub-project, which
             extends the base IDE with support for Polyglot's JL5
             extension

  - jl7/src: the source code for the JL7 IDE sub-project, which
             extends the JL5 IDE with support for Polyglot's JL7
             extension

Disclaimer
----------

Polyglot IDE is research software. Over time, some of the
interfaces in the framework may change. This may require some
extensions to be changed to conform to the new interfaces. Also,
Polyglot IDE is not well-documented; in particular, some of the
Javadoc may be missing or out-of-date. We are working on writing
on writing better documentation. For future updates, watch:

Build requirements
------------------

Polyglot IDE builds on Linux. It likely builds on other platforms,
but this is untested.

We recommend that you use JDK 7 or later. You will experience
problems with older versions of the JDK.

Polyglot IDE requires Eclipse 3.8 (Juno) or later. Older versions
of Eclipse may work, but this is untested.

The "Getting started" section below suggests that you build
against the development version of Polyglot, which requires the
Apache Ant build tool (https://ant.apache.org).

Getting started in Eclipse
--------------------------

 I. Clone Polyglot and add it to your Eclipse workbench.

    1. Go to your Eclipse workspace directory. We will call this
       directory $WORKSPACE from now on.

        $ cd $WORKSPACE

    2. Clone the Polyglot source repository.

        $ git clone https://github.com/polyglot-compiler/polyglot.git

    3. Configure the Eclipse .classpath file for the Polyglot
       project, and compile Polyglot.

        $ cd polyglot
        $ ant eclipse compile

    4. In Eclipse, add the Polyglot project to your workbench.

        a) Invoke the New Java Project dialog:

             File > New > Java Project

        b) In the dialog, enter the project name "Polyglot" and
           click "Finish".

II. Clone Polyglot IDE and add its sub-projects to your Eclipse
    workbench.

    1. Clone the Polyglot IDE source repository into your Eclipse
       workspace directory.

         $ cd $WORKSPACE
         $ git clone https://github.com/polyglot-compiler/polyglot-ide.git

    2. The three top-level directories (base, jl5, and jl7) each
       contain a separate Eclipse project for the respective
       plug-in. Before adding these projects to Eclipse, configure
       the Eclipse .classpath files for these projects.

         $ cd polyglot.ide
         $ ant eclipse

    3. In Eclipse, add the base Polyglot IDE project to your
       workbench.

        a) Invoke the New Java Project dialog:

             File > New > Java Project

        b) In the dialog, enter the project name "polyglot.ide".

        c) Un-check the "Use default location" option. Enter
           the location below and click "Finish".

             $WORKSPACE/polyglot.ide/base

    4. (Optional.) Repeat Step 3 with the following project names
       and locations to add the JL5 and JL7 IDE projects.

        Project name: polyglot.ide.jl5
            Location: $WORKSPACE/polyglot.ide/jl5

        Project name: polyglot.ide.jl7
            Location: $WORKSPACE/polyglot.ide/jl7
